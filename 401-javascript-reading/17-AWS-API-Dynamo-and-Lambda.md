# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

**Amazon API Gateway**

Is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic

And its sits between the backend services of your API and your APIâ€™s users

***Benefits of Amazon API Gateway***

* Map HTTP requests to specific functions in a Serverless application via an API Gateway event

* Map WebSocket events to Serverless functions.

* Use multiple microservices to serve the same top-level API. 

* Save time with integrations: authentication, developer portal, CloudTrail, CloudWatch.

Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.

API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management.
