1. Header: consists of two parts: the type of the token and the signing algorithm being used
2. Payload: contains the claims. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims.
3. Signature: you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.
