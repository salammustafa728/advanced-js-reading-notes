# Ethics in Tech

I read this article [the-code-im-still-ashamed-of](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e)

and I totally agree with the writer because every single program that we as a developer write it will effect a lot of people specially in the medical part.

the article speaks about: 

The firm had been founded by a medical doctor and many of its clients were large pharmaceutical companies. In Canada, there are strict limits on how pharmaceutical companies can advertise prescription drugs directly to consumers. As a result, these companies would create websites that present general information about whatever symptoms their drugs were meant to address. Then, if a visitor could prove they had a prescription, they were given access to a patient portal with more specific info about the drug.

The graphics and general style of the website made it clear that the client wanted to specifically target teenage girls. One of the features of this website was a quiz that asked girls a series of questions and recommended a type of drug based on their answers. Remember, this website was posing as a general information site. When I received the requirements, they contained the questions for the quiz, along with multiple choice answers for each question.

Missing from the requirements was any indication of what I should do with the answers at the end of the quiz. She emailed the client and got me the requirements. Before submitting the website to the client, my project manager decided to give it a quick test. “Well, it seems that no matter what I do, the quiz recommends the client’s drug as the best possible treatment.

As developers, we are often one of the last lines of defense against potentially dangerous and unethical practices. It’s not hard to imagine them recommending prescription drugs soon, too. freeCodeCamp's open source curriculum has helped more than 40,000 people get jobs as developers.
