Increase Community and Peer Recognition

Most people who are passionate about something strive to be recognized for the quality work they produce, and for some, developing software is a huge passion. Many developers are extremely determined to become the best developer they can be to meet certain personal goals, and having your code accepted by a big OSS project is a considered a massive achievement.



Greater Job Prospects

In contrast, commercial software doesn’t provide you with the same proof of your abilities, and overall it is much harder to gain experience in this realm. Improve Software on a User and Business Level. The beauty of OSS compared to proprietary software is that this is all possible. Even if a user isn’t a programmer, he or she can still suggest new features and functionalities to the software’s owner or core team.

If a business owner or company is using a piece of open-source software and would like to make some changes or add new features to meet a certain business need, then this is also a real possibility. The result is a win-win situation, as the business gets a new feature and the software also receives a new feature that can often be utilized by other users. This global and constant collaboration is increasing open-source software’s popularity and is making the software that we use on a daily basis a whole lot better. Here at Clearcode, our development teams regular utilize open-source software in their projects due to the many benefits it offers.
