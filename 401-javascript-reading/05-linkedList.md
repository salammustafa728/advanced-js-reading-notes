##  Linked Lists

Big O: is describe the efficiency of algorithm or function 
It evaluates based on two factors:
1. Running Time 
2. Memory Space

n order to analyze these limiting factors, we should consider 4 Key Areas for analysis:
*  Input Size: its the size of parameter and we use letter **n** to refer to input size.
  *  Units of Measurement:  evaluate a function for Time and Space complexity.
   * Orders of Growth: describe overall efficiency by using the input size n and measuring the overall Units of Space and Time required for the given input size n.
    * Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case: describes the Worst Case for algorithm efficiency, and can still think about Best and Average cases.

## Linked Lists: 
Is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other.

> There are two types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly. 

Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. 

Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node.

Linear data structures vs non-linear data structures
linear: means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed. 
non-linear:  items donâ€™t have to be arranged in order.
