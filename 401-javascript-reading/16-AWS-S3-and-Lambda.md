# AWS: S3 and Lambda

**Amazon S3** is an object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. 

**AWS Lambda**

is a serverless computing service. 
The Lambda functions can perform any kind of computing task, from serving web pages and processing streams of data to calling APIs and integrating with other AWS services. And using AWS Lambda can save you time on operational tasks.

To complete a Serverless stack you’ll need:
* a computing service;
* a database service; 
* an HTTP gateway service.

**Common use cases for AWS Lambda**

* individual tasks run for a short time;
* each task is generally self-contained;
* there is a large difference between the lowest and highest levels in the workload of the application.

Lambda works: AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers.

**Content Delivery Network (CDN)**

is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.
CDNs work through servers nearest to the website visitor respond to the request. 

CyberHoot’s best advice to an SMB is to know what a CDN is, and at most, establish a relationship with a CDN protection vendor without paying for protection. DDoS protection vendors include: Arbor Networks, AT&T, Verizon, and Akamai.
