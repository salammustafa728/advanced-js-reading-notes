# Trees

Trees Terminology:

* Node: refere to node and its value and othor nodes.

* Root: node at the beginning of the tree.

* K - A :  specifies the maximum number of children any node

* Left - A reference to one child node

* Right - A reference to the other child node

* Edge : is the link between a parent and child node

* Leaf : A leaf is a node that does not have any children.

* Height : is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

**Traversals**

Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree

* Depth: is where we prioritize going through the depth and there's three methods of depth: (pre-order, in-order, post-order)


* Breadth: iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node

**Binary Tree Vs K-ary Trees**

Binary Trees restrict the number of children to two 

K-ary Trees can have any number of children per node and
we use K to refer to the maximum number of children that each Node is able to have.


**Binary Search Trees(BST)**

In a BST, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right
