# Redux - Additional Topics


**Redux Toolkit**

The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development



**Making React reactive**

React components are not reactive out of the box. The observer HoC wrapper from the mobx-react-lite package fixes that by basically wrapping the React component in autorun. The next listing defines a few React components. The only MobX specific code in there is the observer wrapping.



Working with references so far we have created observable objects , arrays and primitives. You might be wondering, on the todos. Â« These changes will be picked up automatically by the TodoView. With MobX there is no need to normalize data first and to write selectors to make sure our components will be updated.


**Hookstate**

The simple but incredibly fast and flexible state management that is based on React state hook


**Installation**

`npm install --save @hookstate/core `
