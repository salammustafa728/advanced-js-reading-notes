# React Native

Prerequisites​

While we do our best to assume no prior knowledge of React, Android, or iOS development, these are valuable topics of study for the aspiring React Native developer.

People from many different development backgrounds are learning React Native. You may have experience with a range of technologies, from web to Android to iOS and more.
