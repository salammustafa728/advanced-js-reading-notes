#     Stacks & Queues

## What is a Stack

data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

and te terminology for a stack is **Push** - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed and **Pop** - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped also ther's IsEmpty and peek.

stacks follow these concepts:
* FILO (First In Last Out)

This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

* LIFO (Last In First Out)

This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

and the big O for poping and pushing a node to the stack is o(1).

## What is a Queue

The terminology for a queue is **Enqueue** - Nodes or items that are added to the queue. **Dequeue** - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. **Front** - This is the front/first Node of the queue. **Rear** - This is the rear/last Node of the queue. **Peek** - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. **IsEmpty** - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.


And it follow the concept of FIFO and LIFO

And the big O is O(1).
